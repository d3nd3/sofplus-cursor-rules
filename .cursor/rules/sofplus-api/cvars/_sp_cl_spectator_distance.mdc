### _sp_cl_spectator_distance

_sp_cl_spectator_distance

Set the `r_nearclipdist` variable to this value when in 1st person spectator mode (spectator variable is `2` or `4`).

Values:

- 0: Disable
- >0: Enable; Set `r_nearclipdist` to this value. `20` .. `30` seems to work reasonably well (default = 20).
